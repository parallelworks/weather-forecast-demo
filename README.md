# weather-forecast-demo
Demonstration of weather forecast model running in the cloud.

1. containers - how to build and use the Docker and Singularity containers used in this demo.
2. run - workflow for running the demo
3. vis - visualization tools to postprocess demo output

An alternative to using containers is to directly install
the UFS-SRW and dependencies onto a worker image.  This is
useful if setting up a "tradiational" cluster environment
and documented in `running_ufs_demo_without_docker.md`.
